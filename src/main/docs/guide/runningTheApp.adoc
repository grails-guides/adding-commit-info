After enabling the actuator endpoints, when you run the application you can go to the `/actuator/info` endpoint at http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
and you should see some JSON formatted info like:

```json
{
    app: {
        name: "complete",
        grailsVersion: "3.2.6",
        version: "0.1"
    },
    git: {
        commit: {
            time: "2017-02-16T10:31-0600",
            id: "2f27f2c"
        },
        branch: "master"
    }
}
```
